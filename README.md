# etch-a-sketch

live demo: https://vladarama.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

This HTML/CSS/JS project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

This project is a web based etch-a-sketch game, where you can create your own pixel art.

Features:
* Create a grid size up to 64 x 64 squares.
* Button to reset the grid when the user is done drawing
* Color selector functionality where the user can select any color and start coloring
* RGB mode where the pen's color is randomized and a rainbow can be created.

This is my first real project in Javascript which made it very fun to do even if it was challenging at times. You learn by pushing yourself out of your comfort zone which is what I have done in this project. I deeped my knowledge of DOM Manipulation, of JS basic functions and loops, I increased my understanding of CSS Grids and Flexbox and I learned how to design a responsive, functional and minimal user interface.
